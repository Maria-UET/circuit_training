# Grouping
Grouping (clustering) the standard cells in the circuit training netlist.

## Prerequisite

Download hmetis binary from: [http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/hmetis/download](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/hmetis/download) <br>
Download plc_wrapper_main binary from: [gs://rl-infra-public/circuit-training/placement_cost/plc_wrapper_main](gs://rl-infra-public/circuit-training/placement_cost/plc_wrapper_main) <br>
Download ariane netlist from: [gs://rl-infra-public/circuit-training/netlist/ariane.circuit_graph.pb.txt.gz](gs://rl-infra-public/circuit-training/netlist/ariane.circuit_graph.pb.txt.gz) <br>

Unzip the downloaded netlist file:

```console
gzip -d ariane.circuit_graph.pb.txt.gz
```

## 1. Setup the variables

```console
OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/output
BLOCK_NAME=ariane
NETLIST_FILE=/path/to/the/netlist.pb.txt
HMETIS_DIR=/path/to/the/hmetis/binary
PLC_WRAPPER_MAIN=/path/to/the/plc_wrapper_main
```

#### Note
If your netlist file is larger than 2 GB, please split it into small files,
due to the text proto file size constraint. Then you can pass the netlist input
flag as a comma separated string, for example, 
`--netlist_file=/path/to/netlist_file_1.pb.txt,/path/to/netlist_file_2.pb.txt`

You can use the following tool to split netlist:

```console
python split_proto_netlist_main
--file_name=netlist.pb.txt
--output_dir=/dir/to/output/
```

## 2. Run the code

```console
python circuittraining/grouping/groupermain
--output_dir=$OUTPUT_DIR
--netlist_file=$NETLIST_FILE
--block_name=$BLOCK_NAME
--hmetis_dir=$HMETIS_DIR
--plc_wrapper_main=$PLC_WRAPPER_MAIN
```

#### Output example

You should be able to see the metrics after clustering such as:

```console
grouper.py:336] Wirelength: 4066003.636051
grouper.py:337] Wirelength cost: 0.248466
grouper.py:338] Congestion cost: 1.662051
grouper.py:339] Overlap cost: 0.000034
```

We expect the metrics of clustered netlist within a small margin of the original
unclustered netlist, so that we know the
clustering is a good approximation of standard cellsâ€™ placements.

## F.A.Q.

**Q: Where are the nodes coordinates of the incoming netlist defined?**

**A**: We assume that a netlist that has all its nodes already placed. It does not have to be a good
placement. A low effort, fast version of placement results from any tool can be
used.

**Q: Could you give some hint about how "distance" and "threshold" parameters are determined, for example in the Ariane example?**

**A**  "distance" and "threshold" parameters are specific to each block and
technology. They need to be adjusted by trial and error. Current defaults are good
for Ariane.

**Q: What is the relationship between clustered netlist and adjacency matrix?**

**A**: A cluster (group) of standard cells is treated as a macro. We call them soft macros.
The original macro is called hard macro. The adjacency matrix is built using the
connections between the set of nodes including hard macros and soft macros.

**Q: Assuming the number of nets between cluster_a and cluster_b is
100, what is the value of adj[cluster_a][cluster_b] in the adjacency matrix?**

**A**: The adjacency value is computed as the number of connections between
clusters, in this case would be 100.

**Q: How does the distance of flip flops get involved in the adjacency matrix?**

**A**: It does not.

**Q: Are the values in the adjacency matrix normalized?**

**A**: No. We don't normalize them.
